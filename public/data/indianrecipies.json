If you are using active dry yeast (look like small round balls) - follow the instructions given in the packet.If you are using fast action yeast (looks more like fine semolina) then in a large bowl combine the flours, salt and sugar and gradually add in the yeast and knead the dough until smooth and elastic, adding little flour if it tends to get sticky. Once all of the ingredients form a ball; add the olive oil and place the ball on a work surface and knead the dough for approximately 10 minutes. Repeated kneading combines all the ingredients well and will help the bread rise well in the oven.Once you have finished kneading and gained enough arm muscle; place the dough in a large bowl coated with olive oil and cover it with cling wrap/plastic wrap and allow it to rise for about 2 hours.After two hours you will notice that the dough has doubled. At this point punch the dough down and knead gently. Divide the dough into 10 portions and roll each portion into a ball. Place the balls on a baking sheet and cover them with a damp cloth and let them sit for another 30 minutes.While the dough is resting, preheat the oven to 250 C. The oven should be preheated for at least half an hour before you can bake the pitas in them. Now it should be time to work your dough into flat bread. Take one ball, dust it with a little flour and dust the work surface as well. Using a rolling pin, roll the pita into an oval or a circle. Make sure the pitas are thin; about 1/8th inch or 1/4 inch thick. Continue the same with the remaining dough balls.Place the rolled portion of pita bread on dusted baking sheets and place it inside the oven. Bake the pita dough until they puff - you will see them rising forming bubbles, to slowly puffing and fully puffing up.The whole process takes a maximum or 3-5 minutes and not more than 5 minutes. If the pita bread does not rise in 5 minutes, then take them out. The Pita Bread will still be cooked, but just wont have pockets and will still taste just as good.You can serve Whole Wheat Pita Bread Recipe along with soups or make it into sandwiches like Egg Bhurji Stuffed Pita Pockets Recipe, Aloo Tikki Stuffed Pita Sandwich Recipe, Pita Sandwich With Cauliflower Falafel And Roasted Vegetables Recipe and more.

To make the dumpling (momo) dough;  add the flour into a large mixing bowl, add a little water at a time to the flour and knead well to make a smooth and yet firm dough. We don't add the salt or oil to make the dumpling dough. Cover the dough and allow it to rest for about 20 minutes, till we get the filling ready.Next step is the make the filling for the dumplings. Heat the oil in a saucepan on medium heat.  Add the mushrooms, sprinkle some salt and stir fry on high heat until the mushroom become tender. Mushrooms release a lot of water, so stir-fry until all the moisture evaporates.Once the mushrooms are cooked and dry, allow it to cool. Once the mushrooms cool down, add it to a large bowl and combine it with the remaining filling ingredients including the oil. Our final step is to make the Mushroom DumplingsDivide the dough into small lemon sized portions of an inch in diameter. Dust the dough portions in flour and roll out into a circle. Don’t roll too thick, as the filling will push itself out and tear when steamed.Place a small spoon of filling in the center of the rolled circle. Bring together the edges of the dough with a pinching and folding motion on one side and bring the other side to hold to the pinched side. By doing this, the half moon shaped momos (dumplings) will have a frilled look. Proceed the similar way with the remaining dough.As you keep shaping the dumplings (momos) you need to keep them on a greased platter and cover with a damp cloth to prevent them from drying out.While you are shaping the dumplings (momos), keep a steamer with water boiling. Grease the steamer pan with some oil to prevent the momos from sticking.Place the shaped dumplings (momos) on the greased steamer pan.

","To begin making the Mushroom Dumpling Recipe, we will first make the dough. To make the dumpling (momo) dough;  add the flour into a large mixing bowl, add a little water at a time to the flour and knead well to make a smooth and yet firm dough. We don't add the salt or oil to make the dumpling dough. Cover the dough and allow it to rest for about 20 minutes, till we get the filling ready.Next step is the make the filling for the dumplings. Heat the oil in a saucepan on medium heat.  Add the mushrooms, sprinkle some salt and stir fry on high heat until the mushroom become tender. Mushrooms release a lot of water, so stir-fry until all the moisture evaporates.Once the mushrooms are cooked and dry, allow it to cool. Once the mushrooms cool down, add it to a large bowl and combine it with the remaining filling ingredients including the oil. Our final step is to make the Mushroom DumplingsDivide the dough into small lemon sized portions of an inch in diameter. Dust the dough portions in flour and roll out into a circle. Don’t roll too thick, as the filling will push itself out and tear when steamed.Place a small spoon of filling in the center of the rolled circle. Bring together the edges of the dough with a pinching and folding motion on one side and bring the other side to hold to the pinched side. By doing this, the half moon shaped momos (dumplings) will have a frilled look.
